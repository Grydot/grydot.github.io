You will need a VPN for this method, I recommend cyber ghost as it has servers in Argentina and a 7 day free trial.

Steps:
1. Remove SIM card
2. Clear cache of "galaxy apps" app
3. Restart phone
4. Activate VPN
2. Clear cache of "galaxy apps" again, just to be safe
5. Go to fortnite and choose "samsung store" as the provider
6. Done, the prices should be in ARS ($274, $249, $549, $749 ARS for each option, 1000 vbucks is bugged and is more expensive than it should, $99 ARS)

DISCLAIMER: This method stopped working for me, apparently I got my phone HWID banned from making purchases from Samsung, so be careful. It worked for about 2 weeks and now I get a "server error" whenever I try to buy vbucks. Your Epic account will be safe anyways.

To choose Samsung store as the provider, you have to go to the Game settings and click on the last tab (Account):
IF THE OPTION ISN'T THERE FOR YOU: Try installing Fortnite from the Galaxy app store instead downloading it from Epic's website.
